## rtables.officer 0.1.0

 * Added option to start new pages when exporting different paginated tables to `.docx`. It is possible to put tables on separate pages by doing `export_as_docx(add_page_break = TRUE)`.
 * Added exporter functions for `rlistings` objects.
 * Added separator lines and padding when present in the `rlistings` or `rtables` objects.
 * Fixed bugs impeding pagination of lists of `rlistings` or `rtables` objects.
