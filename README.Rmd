## Exporting `rtables` to Microsoft Word and beyond

The `rtables.officer` package provides a framework to export tables created with
[`rtables`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables/) to Microsoft Word documents. To do so,
we use the `officer` package to create a Word document and the `flextable` package to produce
the intermediary table object that `officer` can use to create the Word document.

Please refer to the following packages for further information:
- [`rtables`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables/) to create tables.
- [`flextable`](https://github.com/davidgohel/flextable) as an intermediate html table object. Many
  aesthetic functionalities are available at this stage.
- [`officer`](https://github.com/davidgohel/officer) to create Word documents. Please consider
  also other exporter options (e.g. `html`) that are available from `flextable`.

`rtables` and `rtables.officer` is developed and copy written by `F. Hoffmann-La Roche` and it is released open source under Apache License Version 2.

## Installation

`rtables.officer` is available on CRAN and you can install the latest released version with:

```r
install.packages("rtables.officer")
```

or you can install the latest development version directly from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("insightsengineering/rtables.officer")
```

## Example
Here's a simple example demonstrating how to create a basic table layout, perform analysis on various columns, and export the resultant table to a Word document in landscape orientation. Further reading are available in the [vignettes](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables.officer/latest-tag/articles/).

```{r}
# Define the table layout
lyt <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("ARM") %>%
  analyze(c("AGE", "BMRKR2", "COUNTRY"))

# Build the table
tbl <- build_table(lyt, ex_adsl)

# Export the table to a Word document in landscape orientation
tf <- tempfile(fileext = ".docx")
export_as_docx(tbl,
  file = tf,
  section_properties = section_properties_default(orientation = "landscape")
)

# Expected output (with default theme)
tt_to_flextable(tbl, theme = theme_docx_default())
```
