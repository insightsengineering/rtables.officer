## Reporting Tables with R

The `rtables` R package was designed to create and display complex
tables with R. The cells in an `rtable` may contain any high-dimensional
data structure which can then be displayed with cell-specific formatting
instructions. Currently, `rtables` can export tables in `ascii`, `html`,
and `pdf` formats.

The `rtables.officer` package is designed to support export formats
related to the Microsoft Office software suite, including Microsoft Word
(`docx`) and Microsoft PowerPoint (`pptx`).

`rtables` and `rtables.officer` are developed and copy written by
`F. Hoffmann-La Roche` and are released open source under Apache License
Version 2.

## Installation

You can install the latest development version of `rtables.officer`
directly from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("insightsengineering/rtables.officer")
```
