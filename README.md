## Exporting `rtables` to Microsoft Word and beyond

The `rtables.officer` package provides a framework to export tables
created with
[`rtables`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables/) to
Microsoft Word documents. To do so, we use the `officer` package to
create a Word document and the `flextable` package to produce the
intermediary table object that `officer` can use to create the Word
document.

Please refer to the following packages for further information: -
[`rtables`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables/) to create
tables. - [`flextable`](https://github.com/davidgohel/flextable) as an
intermediate html table object. Many aesthetic functionalities are
available at this stage. -
[`officer`](https://github.com/davidgohel/officer) to create Word
documents. Please consider also other exporter options (e.g.Â `html`)
that are available from `flextable`.

`rtables` and `rtables.officer` is developed and copy written by
`F. Hoffmann-La Roche` and it is released open source under Apache
License Version 2.
